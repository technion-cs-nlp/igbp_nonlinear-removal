# igbp_nonlinear-removal
This repository contains the code implementation for the Iterative Gradient-Based Projection (IGBP) algorithm proposed in the paper titled 'Shielded Representations: Protecting Sensitive Attributes Through Iterative Gradient-Based Projection' authored by Shadi Iskander, Kira Radinsky and Yonatan Belinkov. The IGBP algorithm aims to remove non-linear encoded concepts from neural representations and mitigate bias in NLP models.
